# Voter Guide Bot ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojowen/voterguidebot/master/app/assets/images/robot.png)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mojowen/voterguidebot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mojowen/voterguidebot)


This is a website that makes voter guides. What's a voter guide? These are:

 * [Chicago](http://chicagovoterguide.org)
 * [Denver](http://sanantoniovoterguide.org)
 * [San Antonio](http://santoniovoterguide.org)
 * [Portland](http://portlandvoterguide.org)
 * [Bozeman](http://bozemanvoterguide.org/)

Currently they're all "bespoke" sites that are built [using some scripts and CSV files](https://github.com/mojowen/ChicagoVoterGuide) but this site is going to build them programmatically, plus a PDF version.
